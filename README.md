# buildingai_FinalProject
An OrderBot based on ChatBot.
The proposed OrderBot is a customized version of a ChatBot based on the OpenAI and designed for the final assignment, in relation to the Deeplearning.ai_Prompt Engineering for Developers course. 

This Bot uses the structure advised in the course with a few changes.
Further iteration of this project should include API integration feature and Zapier integration, in order to coalesce with customersâ€™ favorite business management apps.
